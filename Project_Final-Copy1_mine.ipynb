    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Video games are a popular form of entertainment, but not everyone plays in the same way. Some players spend many hours exploring and interacting with the game, while others play only briefly. Understanding what influences how long people play can help researchers learn about player behavior and engagement.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the University of British Columbia, a research team is studying this using a Minecraft server. On the server, players can explore freely and interact with the environment, and the researchers record their actions. Along with playtime, the team collects information about each player, such as their experience level, subscription status, age, and gender.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to see whether these characteristics can help **predict how long a player will spend in the game**. Specifically, we ask: **Can we estimate the total number of hours a user will play (played_hours) based on their experience, subscription status, gender, and age?** By examining these relationships, we hope to identify factors that are linked to higher or lower engagement.\n"

    "### Dataset 1 (`players.csv`)\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset contains information about **196 individuals**, each representing a player profile. It includes **9 variables** capturing demographic information, subscription status, and engagement metrics. Below is a detailed description of each variable:\n",

    "| organizationName  | float64  |-              | – |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** The `individualId` and `organizationName` columns are entirely empty and provide no usable information. These should be removed during preprocessing.  These fields may not have been collected, applicable, or were lost during data processing.\n",
    " \n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset Issues and Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "A review of the dataset revealed several issues that affect analysis and modeling. Two columns, `individualId` and `organizationName`, contain no usable data and appear to be placeholders. Fields like `name` and `hashedEmail` are identifiers and provide no predictive value, so they are excluded to avoid distorting distance calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some variables require preprocessing. `experience` is ordinal (Beginner to Pro), while non-ordinal fields like `gender` need one-hot encoding for distance-based models. Self-reported fields, such as age and experience, may contain inaccuracies that should be considered when interpreting results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset Preparation and Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains several issues that affect KNN modeling. Two columns, `individualId` and `organizationName`, are empty placeholders, while `name` and `hashedEmail` are identifiers with no predictive value, so they are excluded. Categorical variables need proper encoding: `experience` is ordinal (Beginner to Pro), while fields like `gender` require one-hot encoding. Numerical features such as `age` and `played_hours` should be standardized to prevent any single variable from dominating distance calculations.  Outliers in age or playtime can strongly influence neighbor selection, and uneven distributions of experience levels may reduce the model’s ability to find representative neighbors for some groups. Self-reported fields may also introduce inaccuracies. Addressing these considerations ensures that KNN operates on a clean, meaningful distance space, improving the reliability of predictions."

    "The summary statistics show that most players in this dataset report extremely low playtime: the median is only 0.1 hours, and even the 75th percentile is just 0.6 hours. This means the majority of observations cluster very close to zero, while a few players have much higher values, creating a long right tail (e.g., the maximum of 223 hours). Age is more normally distributed, with most players falling between 17 and 22.\n",

As a result, KNN may struggle to learn meaningful differences unless we handle outliers, scale features, and consider whether the target variable is too skewed for distance-based prediction."

    "## Experience\n",
    "Across all experience levels: Amateur, Beginner, Pro, Regular, and Veteran, most players log very few hours, while only a handful record extremely high playtime. Although we might expect more experienced players to play longer, the distributions are dominated by a **spike at 0–5 hours** and a **long tail extending past 200 hours**, making differences between groups hard to see.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Subscription Status\n",
    "Both Subscribed and Not Subscribed players show the same pattern: most cluster near zero, with only a few extreme high-hour players stretching the x-axis. Subscribed players have slightly more high-hour individuals, but the overall distribution is similar, making it difficult to compare within the range where most data lies.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Gender\n",
    "Female, Male, and Other players all show very low playtime for most individuals, with a few long right-tail outliers. These outliers compress the main distribution, masking any potential differences between genders.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Age\n",
    "The scatterplot of Age vs. Played Hours is heavily right-skewed. Most players, regardless of age, are near zero hours, with a few extreme cases stretching the axis. This makes it hard to see any relationship between age and low-hour playtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why We Needed to Zoom In\n",
    "Extreme high-hour players stretch the x-axes to **0–240+ hours**, while nearly all observations are **0–5 hours**. This causes the main spike to dominate each plot. Zooming in to the **90th percentile of played hours** allows us to clearly examine how **experience, subscription, gender, and age relate to the majority of playtime**."

    "## Zoomed-In Analysis (0 to 2.8 Hours)\n",
    "\n",
    "After restricting the x-axis to the 75th percentile of played hours (about **2.8 hours**), the distributions become much easier to interpret. Removing extreme outliers allows the patterns in low and moderate playtime, the range where almost all players fall, to become visible across experience level, subscription status, gender, and age.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Experience\n",
    "Once the scale is narrowed, every experience group clusters heavily below **1 hour**, with Beginners and Amateurs showing the strongest concentration near 0–0.5 hours. Regular and Veteran players spread out slightly more, yet still remain mostly under 1 hour. Even with this clearer view, the groups do not separate meaningfully, suggesting that low playtime is common regardless of skill level.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Subscription Status\n",
    "Both subscribed and non-subscribed users are tightly concentrated around **0 hours**, but the zoomed plots reveal subtle differences. Subscribed users show a slightly broader spread, with more players appearing between roughly 0.5 and 1.5 hours. Non-subscribed users remain even more compressed near zero. This pattern hints at a modest subscription effect, though it still does not strongly differentiate playtime within this limited range. Additionally, there is overall more subscribed players contributing data, which is important to note.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gender\n",
    "With the outliers removed, the gender distributions become more comparable. Male players who make up most of the dataset—form a dense cluster under 0.5 hours. Female players follow almost the identical pattern but with fewer individuals overall, and other gender identities show the same shape on an even smaller scale. The zoomed view confirms that gender differences are minimal, and that extremely low playtime is typical for all groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Age\n",
    "The zoomed Age vs. Played Hours scatterplot shows that nearly every observation falls under **2.8 hours**, regardless of age. No clear relationship or trend is visible; younger and older players alike cluster near zero. Removing the outliers makes the uniformity across ages much easier to see."

    "# Interpretation of the Predicted vs Actual Plots\n",
    "\n",
    "These two visualizations (zoomed and unzoomed actual vs predicted hours played) show a clear **bias pattern**: the model tends to **overpredict** playtime for low-hour users and **underpredict** for high-hour users.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each point represents a user, where the **x-axis** is the actual hours played and the **y-axis** is the predicted hours by the model. For users with **0 actual hours**, many predicted values are as high as **16 hours**, indicating a **positive bias** (overestimation) for non-players, visible in the zoomed graph. Conversely, users with higher actual hours (e.g., ~27 hours) can have predictions much lower than the true value, showing a **negative bias** (underestimation), visible in the unzoomed graph. Overall, the dominant pattern is **overestimation** in the common **0–5 hours range**, where most users are concentrated.\n",
    "\n",
    "The KNN model predicts based on the **average behavior of nearest neighbors**. Since most users have low playtime, neighbors of low-hour users may include some moderate players, causing **overprediction**. Extreme high-hour users have few similar neighbors, leading to **underestimation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Research question:** *Can we estimate total hours played (`played_hours`) based on experience, subscription status, gender, and age?* The positive bias for low-hour users and negative bias for high-hour users indicates the model is **systematically inaccurate across the range of playtime**. Predictions are **widely scattered** around the diagonal line, showing **substantial error** even in the common playtime range.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the current KNN model and selected features, **predictions are not reliably accurate**. There is a tendency to **overpredict low-hour users** and **underpredict high-hour users**, likely due to the distribution of playtime in the dataset and the averaging nature of KNN."

    "### 1) Loading the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "We imported **pandas**, **altair**, **sklearn**, and **numpy** for data handling, modeling, and visualization. The dataset was loaded into a DataFrame using `pd.read_csv` from the variable `url`.\n",
    "\n",

    "Irrelevant columns to the prediction such as **hashedEmail**, **individualID**, **organizationName**, and **name** were removed. The **subscribe** variable was recoded into **Subscribed** and **Not Subscribed**, and **gender** was grouped into **Male**, **Female**, and **Other** (including non-binary and agender) to simplify analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
    "\n",
    "We examined how **played hours** relates to **experience**, **subscription status**, **gender**, and **age** (scatterplot). The distribution of played hours was highly skewed: most players logged very few hours, with a small number of extreme high-hour users. Faceting helped compare patterns across categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4) Preparing Data for Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset was split into **training (75%)** and **testing (25%)** sets using `train_test_split` with a fixed seed to ensure reproducibility (**113**). Features included **experience, subscription status, gender, and age**, while **played hours** was the target.

    "\n",
    "The optimal **k = 38** was selected. The final model achieved an **RMSPE of 25.94** on the test set, reflecting substantial prediction error due to the skewed dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6) Visualizing Results\n",
    "\n",
    "Scatterplots of **predicted vs actual hours** revealed bias patterns: low-hour users (especially 0 hours) were often **overestimated**, while high-hour users (20+ hours) were **underestimated**. Zooming in on the **0–5 hour range** showed that nearly all points were underestimated, except exact zeros, which were overestimated. This reflects the dataset’s **strong skew** and the **averaging nature of KNN**."

    "Predicting total hours played using experience, subscription status, gender, and age is very challenging. Most players recorded **very low playtime**, often **0 hours**, while a few players logged extremely high hours (sometimes **30–180 hours**). This creates a **highly skewed distribution**, which is evident in our visualizations: the majority of players cluster near zero, while a few extreme cases stretch the axes, making patterns among most players hard to see.\n",

Even when focusing on this range, differences between groups are small, suggesting these features provide **limited information** about why some players play much more than others.\n",
    "\n",
    "The KNN model we applied reflects this pattern. Using the optimal **k = 38**, the model’s RMSPE was **25.94**, meaning typical prediction errors are about 26 hours—roughly the same as the standard deviation of the testing data (~27 hours). In other words, the model still struggles to predict actual playtime accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because most players have 0 hours:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Low-hour users are overpredicted**, since even a few moderate-hour neighbors raise the average.  \n",
    "- **High-hour users are underpredicted**, because they have few similar neighbors, and averaging pulls predictions down.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This bias is clear in the predicted–actual scatterplots: low-hour users are often predicted to play a few hours when they played none, and high-hour users are consistently underestimated. Predictions cluster poorly around the diagonal, showing overall inaccuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also considered linear regression, but KNN performed better with such a skewed dataset. A linear model would be strongly affected by extreme outliers, overpredicting for 0-hour players and underpredicting for high-hour players. KNN adapts locally and avoids some of this distortion, though overall accuracy remains low.\n",
    "\n",
    "These results suggest that **age, gender, subscription status, and experience** are insufficient for predicting individual playtime. While the model cannot reliably identify highly engaged players, it does reveal a clear pattern: **most users engage very little**, and a small number of extreme users contribute disproportionately to total playtime. Understanding this skew is important for analyzing overall engagement trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Future directions\n",
    "\n",
    "To improve predictions, future research could:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Handle extreme outliers** separately or analyze low-, moderate-, and high-hour groups individually.  \n",
    "- **Include behavioral features**, such as session frequency, in-game actions, or social interactions.  \n",
    "- **Test performance changes** when zero-hour players are excluded or high-hour players are modeled differently.  \n",
    "\n",
    "These steps could help identify what truly drives engagement and improve predictions of playtime. "
