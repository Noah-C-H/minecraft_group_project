    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Video games are a popular form of entertainment, but not everyone plays in the same way. Some players spend many hours exploring and interacting with the game, while others play only briefly. Understanding what influences how long people play can help researchers learn about player behavior and engagement.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the University of British Columbia, a research team is studying this using a Minecraft server. On the server, players can explore freely and interact with the environment, and the researchers record their actions. Along with playtime, the team collects information about each player, such as their experience level, subscription status, age, and gender.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to see whether these characteristics can help **predict how long a player will spend in the game**. Specifically, we ask: **Can we estimate the total number of hours a user will play (played_hours) based on their experience, subscription status, gender, and age?** By examining these relationships, we hope to identify factors that are linked to higher or lower engagement.\n"

    "### Dataset 1 (`players.csv`)\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset contains information about **196 individuals**, each representing a player profile. It includes **9 variables** capturing demographic information, subscription status, and engagement metrics. Below is a detailed description of each variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Variable Name     | Dtype    | Description              | Summary Statistic |\n",
    "|-------------------|----------|---------------------------|-------------------|\n",

    "| subscribe         | bool     | Subscription status       | – |\n",
    "| hashedEmail       | object   | Encrypted email ID        | – |\n",
    "| played_hours      | float64  | Total playtime (hours)    | refer to summary_stats |\n",
    "| name              | object   | Participant name          | – |\n",
    "| gender            | object   | Gender                    | – |\n",

    "| organizationName  | float64  |-              | – |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** The `individualId` and `organizationName` columns are entirely empty and provide no usable information. These should be removed during preprocessing.  These fields may not have been collected, applicable, or were lost during data processing.\n",
    " \n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset Issues and Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "A review of the dataset revealed several issues that affect analysis and modeling. Two columns, `individualId` and `organizationName`, contain no usable data and appear to be placeholders. Fields like `name` and `hashedEmail` are identifiers and provide no predictive value, so they are excluded to avoid distorting distance calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some variables require preprocessing. `experience` is ordinal (Beginner to Pro), while non-ordinal fields like `gender` need one-hot encoding for distance-based models. Self-reported fields, such as age and experience, may contain inaccuracies that should be considered when interpreting results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset Preparation and Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains several issues that affect KNN modeling. Two columns, `individualId` and `organizationName`, are empty placeholders, while `name` and `hashedEmail` are identifiers with no predictive value, so they are excluded. Categorical variables need proper encoding: `experience` is ordinal (Beginner to Pro), while fields like `gender` require one-hot encoding. Numerical features such as `age` and `played_hours` should be standardized to prevent any single variable from dominating distance calculations.  Outliers in age or playtime can strongly influence neighbor selection, and uneven distributions of experience levels may reduce the model’s ability to find representative neighbors for some groups. Self-reported fields may also introduce inaccuracies. Addressing these considerations ensures that KNN operates on a clean, meaningful distance space, improving the reliability of predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Loading the data\n",
    "\n",
    "We imported Python libraries: pandas, altair, sklearn, and numpy for data manipulation, modeling, and visualization. The dataset was loaded into a DataFrame using `pd.read_csv` with the data URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Cleaning and preprocessing data\n",
    "\n",
    "Irrelevant columns (`hashedEmail`, `individualID`, `organizationName`, `name`) were removed. The `subscribe` column was recoded into \"Subscribed\" and \"Not Subscribed,\" and `gender` was grouped into Male, Female, and Other (non-binary, Agender, Two-Spirited, etc.). The dataset was split into training (75%) and testing (25%) sets using `train_test_split` with a fixed seed (113) before exploratory analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) EDA\n",
    "\n",
    "We examined relationships between `played_hours` and predictors using histograms and scatterplots for `experience`, `subscribe`, `gender`, and `age`. Distributions were highly skewed: most players logged very few hours, while a small group had very high hours. To better visualize low-hour players, histograms of the bottom 90% of `hours_played` were plotted, revealing many with 0–0.5 hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Preparing data for modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "Features included `experience`, `subscribe`, `gender`, and `age`, with `played_hours` as the target. Categorical variables were one-hot encoded, `experience` was ordinally encoded, and `age` was scaled for KNN regression. A pipeline combined preprocessing and `KNeighborsRegressor`. Optimal `k` values (1–50) were searched via 3-fold cross-validation using RMSE to select the best model.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Modeling with KNN Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimal `k` was 38 (RMSE = 25.90), but RMSE improved only slightly after `k = 12` (RMSE = 27.06). To simplify the model and reduce underfitting, `k = 12` was chosen. The final model trained on the training set yielded a test RMSE of 23.96.\n",
    "\n",
    "6) Visualizing results\n",
    "\n",
    "Scatterplots of predicted vs. actual hours highlighted model performance. High-hour players (20+ hours) were underestimated, with no predictions above 40 hours. Low-hour players (0–5 hours) were often overestimated. Overall, points were scattered around the predicted = actual diagonal, showing limited accuracy and correlation."

    "The summary statistics show that most players in this dataset report extremely low playtime: the median is only 0.1 hours, and even the 75th percentile is just 0.6 hours. This means the majority of observations cluster very close to zero, while a few players have much higher values, creating a long right tail (e.g., the maximum of 223 hours). Age is more normally distributed, with most players falling between 17 and 22.\n",

As a result, KNN may struggle to learn meaningful differences unless we handle outliers, scale features, and consider whether the target variable is too skewed for distance-based prediction."

Although we might expect more experienced players to play longer, the distributions are dominated by a **spike at 0–5 hours** and a **long tail extending past 200 hours**, making differences between groups hard to see.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Subscription Status\n",
    "Both Subscribed and Not Subscribed players show the same pattern: most cluster near zero, with only a few extreme high-hour players stretching the x-axis. Subscribed players have slightly more high-hour individuals, but the overall distribution is similar, making it difficult to compare within the range where most data lies.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Gender\n",
    "Female, Male, and Other players all show very low playtime for most individuals, with a few long right-tail outliers. These outliers compress the main distribution, masking any potential differences between genders.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Age\n",
    "The scatterplot of Age vs. Played Hours is heavily right-skewed. Most players, regardless of age, are near zero hours, with a few extreme cases stretching the axis. This makes it hard to see any relationship between age and low-hour playtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why We Needed to Zoom In\n",
    "Extreme high-hour players stretch the x-axes to **0–240+ hours**, while nearly all observations are **0–5 hours**. This causes the main spike to dominate each plot. Zooming in to the **90th percentile of played hours** allows us to clearly examine how **experience, subscription, gender, and age relate to the majority of playtime**."

    "## Zoomed-In Analysis (0 to 2.8 Hours)\n",
    "\n",
    "After restricting the x-axis to the 75th percentile of played hours (about **2.8 hours**), the distributions become much easier to interpret. Removing extreme outliers allows the patterns in low and moderate playtime, the range where almost all players fall, to become visible across experience level, subscription status, gender, and age.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Experience\n",
    "Once the scale is narrowed, every experience group clusters heavily below **1 hour**, with Beginners and Amateurs showing the strongest concentration near 0–0.5 hours. Regular and Veteran players spread out slightly more, yet still remain mostly under 1 hour. Even with this clearer view, the groups do not separate meaningfully, suggesting that low playtime is common regardless of skill level.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Subscription Status\n",
    "Both subscribed and non-subscribed users are tightly concentrated around **0 hours**, but the zoomed plots reveal subtle differences. Subscribed users show a slightly broader spread, with more players appearing between roughly 0.5 and 1.5 hours. Non-subscribed users remain even more compressed near zero. This pattern hints at a modest subscription effect, though it still does not strongly differentiate playtime within this limited range. Additionally, there is overall more subscribed players contributing data, which is important to note.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gender\n",
    "With the outliers removed, the gender distributions become more comparable. Male players who make up most of the dataset—form a dense cluster under 0.5 hours. Female players follow almost the identical pattern but with fewer individuals overall, and other gender identities show the same shape on an even smaller scale. The zoomed view confirms that gender differences are minimal, and that extremely low playtime is typical for all groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Age\n",
    "The zoomed Age vs. Played Hours scatterplot shows that nearly every observation falls under **2.8 hours**, regardless of age. No clear relationship or trend is visible; younger and older players alike cluster near zero. Removing the outliers makes the uniformity across ages much easier to see."

    "\n",
    "These visualizations (zoomed and unzoomed actual vs predicted hours) reveal a clear **bias pattern**: the model **overpredicts** low-hour users and **underpredicts** high-hour users.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each point represents a user (**x-axis**: actual hours, **y-axis**: predicted hours). Users with **0 hours** are sometimes predicted as high as **16 hours**, showing **positive bias**, while high-hour users (e.g., ~27 hours) are predicted much lower, showing **negative bias**. The dominant pattern is **overestimation** in the common **0–5 hour range**, where most users are.\n",
    "\n",
    "KNN predicts based on the **average of nearest neighbors**. Low-hour users often have moderate-hour neighbors, causing **overprediction**, while extreme high-hour users have few similar neighbors, leading to **underprediction**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Research question:** *Can we estimate total hours played (`played_hours`) from experience, subscription status, gender, and age?* The observed bias indicates the model is **systematically inaccurate** across playtime. Predictions scatter widely around the diagonal, showing **substantial error** even in common ranges. With the current KNN model and features, **predictions are not reliably accurate**, primarily due to the skewed distribution of playtime and the averaging nature of KNN. Thus, the answer to our question with the methods we have tested is **No**; using experience, subscription status, gender, and age alone, we cannot reliably estimate total hours played."

    "Predicting total hours played using experience, subscription status, gender, and age is challenging. Most players recorded **very low playtime**, often **0 hours**, while a few logged extremely high hours (**30–180 hours**), creating a **highly skewed distribution**. Visualizations show most players clustered near zero, with a few extreme cases stretching the axes, obscuring patterns.\n",

    "Focusing on the **90th percentile of playtime**, low-hour behavior is consistent across experience, subscription, gender, and age. Differences between groups are small, suggesting these features provide **limited information** about why some players play much more than others.\n",
    "\n",
    "The KNN model reflects this pattern. Using **k = 38**, RMSPE was **25.94**, roughly the standard deviation of the test data (~27 hours). RMSE was slightly higher at 27 for **k = 12**, but we chose **k = 38** to reduce underfitting and capture extreme high-hour users better. Typical prediction errors remain large, showing the model struggles to predict playtime accurately.\n",

    "- **Low-hour users are overpredicted**, as moderate-hour neighbors raise the average.  \n",
    "- **High-hour users are underpredicted**, due to few similar neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Predicted–actual scatterplots highlight this bias: low-hour users are predicted a few hours above zero, while high-hour users are underestimated. Points scatter widely around the diagonal, showing overall inaccuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression performed worse due to extreme outliers. KNN adapts locally, reducing some distortion, though overall accuracy remains low.\n",
    "\n",
    "These results suggest **age, gender, subscription status, and experience** are insufficient for predicting individual playtime. Most users engage very little, and a small number of extreme users dominate total hours, reflecting the skew in engagement.\n",

    "To improve predictions:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Handle extreme outliers** or model low-, moderate-, and high-hour groups separately.  \n",
    "- **Include behavioral features**, such as session frequency, in-game actions, or social interactions.  \n",
    "- **Test effects** of excluding zero-hour players or modeling high-hour users differently.  \n",
    "\n",
    "These steps could better reveal what drives engagement and improve playtime predictions."
